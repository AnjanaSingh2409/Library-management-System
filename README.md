# Library-management-System
The Database Library System is intended to Automate the library activities such as creating a new borrower, giving books to the borrowers, maintaining the details of all the item that were available in the books . 

Create a Library Management System. Following are the expected outputs:

1) Think about the tables we will need to run a library.
2) Figure out the cases like issuing a book, returning a book, checking the fine due etc. Basically we need to think about all the operations which we do in a library and then write down the queries to execute them.
